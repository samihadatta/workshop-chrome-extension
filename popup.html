<!-- Reflection Questions:
What functionality would you implement in an extension that could help in the day-to-day? For that functionality, would you use a page action or browser action for your icon in the browser?
I think browser actions make sense because to take up that much real estate on a browser, having an extension that does stuff for many pages makes sense.
A weather extension could be interesting/useful? Or a schedule one where it loads your schedule in quickly? I feel like most of these will have already been done.

Think about your favorite extension or a popular extension. Try to explain the features of the extension and how it was implemented. 
One of my favorite extensions is Eye Dropper, which allows a person to click anywhere on the screen and will tell you the color. I think it includes a color picker and is definitely a 
browser extension as opposed to a page one.
